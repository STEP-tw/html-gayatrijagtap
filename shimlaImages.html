        <h3>Summer Hill</h3>
        <p>
          Summer Hill is a picturesque spot on Shimla-Kalka railway line that offers amazing views of the snow
          covered
          mountains. Located only a few kilometers away from Shimla, this lovely township offers quiet surroundings
          and
          scenic views of the nearby hills. Summer Hill is the same place where Mahatma Gandhi had visited and stayed
          at
          the elegant Georgian House of Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur. The place seems to be fully covered with snow during
          winter and extremely pleasant during summers. The Himachal University too is located in the stunning
          backdrop
          of Summer Hill.

        <h3>The Ridge</h3>
        <p>
          The Ridge is a large open space in the heart of Mall road that provides an excellent view of the mountain
          ranges engulfed in the beauty of nature. It is one of the most famous attractions in Shimla that is worth
          seeing with family and friends. The Ridge connects the Mall road at the Scandal point on the west side and
          offers a panoramic view of the snowy mountains of Shimla.

        <h3>The Glen</h3>
        <p>
          Glen is a u shaped valley, located near to Andale and Summer Hill forest amid dense forest of deodar and pine
          trees. This famous spot has a hiking trail that extends towards Summer Hill and Chora maidan, where tourists
          get to explore the dense surroundings of Shimla while enjoying the calmness and the greenery around. There is
          a small stream of water at the Glen, which turns wide at some place and narrow at some.
