        <h3>Rohtang Pass</h3>
        <p>
          Rohtang Pass- a gateway to Lahaul and Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh, remains one of the most spectacular
          destinations in the entire Kullu region. This picturesque pass is located around 51 kms away from Manali, at
          a height of 3980 meters, on Manali Keylong highway. This mountain slope is so beautiful that people from
          every corner of the country visit this place to take part in adventure sports such as skiing, ice-skating,
          paragliding, etc. The Rohtang Pass is open for tourist from April to October and the permission to travel on
          this highway is given by the Indian Army, once they clear the snow.

        <h3>Rahala Falls</h3>
        <p>
          The stunning Rahala Falls is located at a height of 8,500 ft and about 16 km from Manali. It is located on
          the way to Rohtang Pass and whoever visits the Rohtang valley makes a halt at Rahala Falls to enjoy the
          scenic beauty of the place. One can click pictures, trek above the cliff and enjoy the melting ice of this
          fall. The Rahala waterfall is a result of melting glacier, and so the water of this fall is extremely cold.
          This fall is set amidst dense forest of deodar, silver birch trees, and fresh and aromatic air. This place is
          easily accessible from Manali and one can take a bus, car, bike, or pony to reach the spot.
